        <h3>Crime Patterns</h3>
        <p>We can use the charts and tables related to crime data to find out interesting aspects.</p>

        <h4>Top crime locations</h4>
        <p>If we look at the tables for the crime locations, we can soon notice that the top locations are strictly correlated to the geographic areas where the crime happened.</p>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-12">
            <img src="image/find3.png" class="img-responsive center" alt="Responsive image" />
            <p>
                <br>In this picture we selected an area of the far south suburbs. We can notice that the crimes happen mostly on the streets and in residences for violent crimes.
                <br>Moreover, the locations here coincide with those of Chicago, so we can infer that the overall trend of the city is given by the locations of crimes which happen in suburban areas like this one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <br>

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-12">
            <img src="image/find4.png" class="img-responsive center" alt="Responsive image" />
            <p>
                <br>In this picture we look at the crime locations in the Loop. In contrast to what happened with the suburbs, here the trend is quite different from that of the city: violent crimes happen mostly on the sidewalk and not in private locations such as residences; property crimes happen mostly in department stores and restaurants, which makes sense since this is the commercial and turistic area of the city.
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <br>

        <p>Let us focus on the quality of life crimes' locations:</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-5">
            <img src="image/deceptive.png" class="img-responsive center" alt="Responsive image" />
            <p>
                <br>In the Loop, the top location for quality-of-life crimes are restaurants. If we look at the detail of the types of crime we can notice that here the most popular crime is "deceptive practice". This crime here has density per mile which is far higher than the overall city one (as we can see from the barplot).
                <br>This can be easily linked to the location of crimes: in the Loop many restaurants are sued for deceptive practices towards their customers, for example deceptive billing practices are very common here.

        <h3>Curious Facts</h3>
        <h4>City of Chicago Auto Pond</h4>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
            <img src="image/find1.png" class="img-responsive center" alt="Responsive image" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
            <img src="image/find2.png" class="img-responsive center" alt="Responsive image" />
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of the very first findings we did was related to a high concentration of abandoned vehicles on Wacker Drive.
            <br>It was a strange fact, both because it is difficult to have such a concentration of abandoned vehicles and because the place is in the Loop, so it is unlikely to have so many abandoned vehicles.
            <br>Turns out, after some further investigation, that in this place there's the "City of Chicago Auto Pond", where many of the towed vehicles get delivered.
            <br>So the evidence suggest that many abandoned vehicles are probably discovered elsewhere and towed to this place: these vehicles are of low interest for the user's trip decisions, but it is anyway a nice discovery.
